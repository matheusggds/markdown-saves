# Must Haves on a Project

This is just a guide to what every project _should_ have.

### Package.json
Package.json is a very important files responsable to tell us what are our project _dependencies_ and _version_

You can start with `npm init` then follow the instructions.

For more: [npmjs](https://docs.npmjs.com)

### .gitignore
*.gitignore* is extremely usefull to tell `Git` what from our folder must go to repository. There is a lot of time that you has folders that are built at runtime that you dont need it on your repository, then, you use .gitignore.

You can start using [gitignore npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gitignore).

`npm i gitignore -g`

use `gitignore -types` to see a list of all typex. <br>
Ex.: `gitignore Node` simple like that.
